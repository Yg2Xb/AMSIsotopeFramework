# AMS Isotope Framework - Physics & Analysis Configuration
# Version: 2.0 (Task-Driven)
#
# This file defines WHAT to analyze (physics settings).
# The python script (run_process.py) defines HOW to run it (job control).
# ===================================================================

# 1. Defines the primary particle being analyzed in this configuration.
#    This affects which set of isotopes and parameters are loaded.
current_particle: Beryllium

# 2. Particle definitions library.
#    The framework will load the configuration for the 'current_particle'.
particle_definitions:
  Beryllium:
    charge: 4
    isotopes:
      - { name: "Be7",  mass: 7 }
      - { name: "Be9",  mass: 9 }
      - { name: "Be10", mass: 10 }
  Lithium:
    charge: 3
    isotopes:
      - { name: "Li6", mass: 6 }
      - { name: "Li7", mass: 7 }

# 3. Analysis Chain Definition.
#    Defines the specific combination of algorithms and cuts to be used.
#    The C++ code will use this ID to select the correct logic.
analysis_chain:
  chain_id: "UNBL1IGBLRINGR_v1" # Example
  rigidity_algorithm: "GBL"
  velocity_algorithm: "RINGR"
  acceptance_type: "L1Inner"

# 4. Data Sample Definitions.
#    This section is the master list of all available data samples.
#    The `run_process.py` script reads this to find the file paths.
samples_to_process:
  - name: "ISS_Beryllium"
    type: "ISS"
    # The list of histograms this sample should produce.
    # The C++ code reads this from the config to book the correct histograms.
    histograms:
      - "ISS.ID.H1"
      - "ISS.ID.H2"
    # The master list of raw data files for this sample.
